## Our solution

This solution is presented with a childlike graphical interface, so as to help the child in his assisted therapy in the best possible way; the first screen presents an interactive little man with which one can select the part of the body to be trained, and then subsequently activate the exposure phase.

Once the exposure phase is initiated, the child has the option to expose himself to the "risk" and then monitor the sensation by performing the given exercises (basic exercise list, with video).

Then, for a period of time defined by the doctor, the child should try to hold back the "tic" for the given period of time.

Once time has elapsed, the number of managed and unmanaged “ticks” can be monitored.

It is also possible to check the number for previous periods, through a dedicated section
